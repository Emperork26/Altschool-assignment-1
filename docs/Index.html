      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am Ohaegbulam Ebubechukwu Kennedy. I enjoy gaming, traveling, and cooking.
        I'm currently studying in the Backend track of the School of Engineering at AltSchool.
        I am passionate about building reliable server-side systems and using technology to solve real problems.

      <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I joined AltSchool because I wanted a practical, project-focused learning environment
        where I could move quickly from theory to real-world backend development. I wanted access
        to hands-on experience with modern backend tools (APIs, databases, deployment, and testing),
        collaboration with other motivated engineers, and mentorship that helps me build production-ready
        systems — not just textbook examples. In short: AltSchool offered me the speed, structure, and
        community to level-up into a backend engineer who can build systems that actually deliver value.

      <h2>Short-term Backend Goals (during the program)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Master one backend stack (for example: Node.js/Express or Python/Flask) and a relational database (PostgreSQL).</li>
        <li>Build and deploy at least 3 production-like APIs with authentication, validation, and tests.</li>
        <li>Learn containerization (Docker) and deploy a service to a cloud provider (for example: Heroku, AWS, or similar).</li>
        <li>Write automated tests for endpoints and set up simple CI so my services are reliable as I iterate.</li>
        <li>Contribute to an open-source or team project to practice collaboration, code review, and release workflow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Long-term Career Goals (after the program)</h2>
      <p>
        Become a Senior Backend Engineer or Backend Architect who designs and builds scalable,
        maintainable systems — ideally focusing on products that improve access to services
        in Africa (fintech, healthtech, or education). I want to lead engineering efforts, mentor
        junior developers, and potentially co-found or join a startup where I can drive technical strategy
        and deliver resilient backend infrastructure at scale.
